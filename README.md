# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Specialization â€” My Revision Notes & Labs

This repository contains my personal **revisions, implementations, and notes** from the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by **Andrew Ng** (Stanford University & DeepLearning.AI).  
It serves as both a **study companion** and a **practical reference** for core machine learning concepts, implemented from scratch and using modern Python tools.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The **Machine Learning Specialization** is a foundational course that covers the key principles of supervised and unsupervised learning, linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and more.  

This repo includes:
- Rewritten and optimized versions of the original course labs.  
- Notes summarizing mathematical derivations and algorithm intuition.
